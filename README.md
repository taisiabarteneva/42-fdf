# fdf
#### 42 school project
The goal of the project is to create a simple 3D map. The coordinates of a map are stored in a file passed as a parameter to the program.

This is my first graphical project. I have learned how to do some simple actions, such as create a window, handle key events, draw simple objects.

## How to build 
```
$> make 
 ```
## How to launch
```
$> ./fdf <file.txt>
```
Allowed functions :
- open, read, write, close
- malloc, free
- perror, strerror
- exit
- functions from math library
- functions from miniLibX (42 school internal lib) library
